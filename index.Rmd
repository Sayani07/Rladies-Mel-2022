- We know geom_* can be used to specify a plot, but don't know how ggplot2 translates this plot specification into an image.

- Need to have some understanding to design extensions.

# ggplot2 Extensions

 - Extensions for all components are possible, theme being the easiest one and geom and stat being the most common one.

 - Today's talk focuses on extending the key elements that builds up the layers of ggplot - `stat_*()` and `geom_*()` 

> Unfortunately, due to an early design mistake I called these either stat_() or geom_(). A better decision would have been to call them layer_() functions: that’s a more accurate description because every layer involves a stat and a geom.

- Even though data is tidy, may not represent te values you want to display

- Do not transform your already tidy data so that it contains those values

- pass your original tidy data into ggplot() as in and allow stat_*() functions to apply transformations internally

- stat_* customised for both their geoms and their transformation functions and works similar to geom_*() functions in other regards

- If you want to use a different geom, make sure that your transformation function calculates all the required aesthetics for that geom

# My experience

- Difficult to connect ggplot2 interface and underlying machinery

- Lost in long raw codes of primitive geoms and not understanding how the codes all fits together. 

- Guides on ggplot internals are not yet so ubiquitous

- But it is possible! We did it and so can you.

]
???
- Start small and get help

- Wait for experienced developers to host webinars, release official guides before on ggplot2 extensions OR make a modest start?

# Example: Build new stat and new geom

Package gghdr

- stat_* functions to be inherited from the R package `hdrcde`
- geom_* functions are built to produce the new plotting symbols

---

#  Action plan?
 - Developing an extension usually starts with idea of what to draw!
 - If your desired geom looks similar to an existing geom, start from there, for example, hdr.boxplot() looks similar to geom_boxplot()
 - Subclass one of the existing main ggproto classes
 - Naming scheme: The convention for class names is to prefix with the parent (or ancestor) ggproto class name and use upper camel case, e.g. GeomPoint

Making a new geom  

 - The layer need to combine the output of multiple geoms

 - The geom needs to return grobs not currently available from existing geoms

 - collection of grobs rather than a modified data.frame and this is something outside of the comfort zone of many developers

 - Still, Apart from the last point above, it is possible to get by without having to think too much about grid and grobs.

- The main functionality of geoms is, like for stats, a tiered succession of calls: draw_layer(), draw_panel(), and draw_group().

- setup_params()+setup_data() 
One note, though, is that setup_data() is called before any position adjustment is done as part of the build step.

# Making a new stat

- benefits of stats is that they are purely about data transformations, which most R users are used to be doing.


- stat is encapsulated in a tiered succession of calls: compute_layer(), compute_panel(), and compute_group()

- Outside of the compute_*() functions, the remaining logic is found in the setup_params() and setup_data() functions

- The setup_params() function receives the parameters given during construction along with the layer data, and returns a modified list of parameters.

- The setup_data() function receives the modified parameters along with the layer data, and returns the modified layer data


 As a rule of thumb, if the stat operates on multiple rows, start by implementing a compute_group() method, and if the stat operates on single rows, implement a compute_panel() method. 
 
 Because we’ve written a new stat, we get a number of features, like scaling and faceting, for free:

- need to extend the functionality of ggplot2

Defining features of a circle??
